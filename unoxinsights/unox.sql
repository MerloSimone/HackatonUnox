Here are some tips that may help resolve this:\n\n- Make sure the oven is level. An unleveled oven can cause water to pool and leak out. You can adjust the leveling legs underneath to make it level.\n\n- Check the water reservoir and steam vent. Overflow or clogs in these areas can lead to water spilling into the oven. Clean out any debris and make sure the water reservoir is not overfilled. \n\n- Inspect the oven door seal. A damaged or worn seal will allow steam and moisture to escape from the oven cavity. The seal may need to be replaced.\n\n- Try running a self-cleaning cycle which can help dry out any excess water buildup inside the oven. \n\nIf none of these tips resolve your issue, I recommend having a technician inspect the oven for any other leaks or part failures. Please let me know if you need help arranging a service appointment. I\'m happy to assist further in getting this taken care of.','2024-03-10 08:35:32','Technical Support','Customer is experiencing a water leak from their oven and is asking for help troubleshooting the iss',10),(11,'Tell me about cheftop-x oven\r\n','Thank you for your interest in the cheftop-x oven.
